# Python Template

This is a template for a Python project.

## Random Data

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Source code for the project.
- `docs/`: Documentation for the project.
- `data/`: Data files for the project

## Tools

We use three main tools for development:

- **[UV](docs/uv.md)** - For Python package management and development tasks
- **[Taskfile](docs/taskfile.md)** - For automating common development tasks
- **[Modal (optional)](docs/modal.md)** - For running and deploying Python code in the cloud

## Getting Started

0. Check the individual documentation files for each tool
1. Run `task setup` -- granted you have Taskfile installed.
    - See the [Taskfile documentation](docs/taskfile.md) for more details.
2. Run `task help` to see all available tasks or review the [Taskfile.yml](./Taskfile.yml)
